# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

In this assignment, we established a website with a dynamic table that house UFO sighting information. In this website, users are able filter by city, state, country, shape or date  of the UFO sigthing based on information that is stored in a Javascript file. In this assignment, we utilize a Javascript file and application to display, CSS style guide to enhance the visuals on the webpage and an HTML file to configure the actions on the website.  

## Results 

With this website, users can refresh the page and filter the data table for desired information that they would like to see. To filter the data in the data table, users can input values into the boxes to the left of the data table. Default values are entered into the view to show users what the format of their entries should look like.

Users must select ***UFO Sightings*** at the top of the page to refresh and clear the filter options that were applied. 

## Summary:

Drawback of this webpage include static dataset filter search is limited to data that is limited to the data.js file. 
For further development include:
- Additional sources using API in which the data table will include more recent data that individuals can access.
- Allow users to upload and download new data that can be filtered and manipulated via 
- Furthermore, an additional advancement include allowing comparison of data over time and the possibility of doing predicitive modelling with the data that we have.
